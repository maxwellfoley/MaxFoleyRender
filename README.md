# MaxFoleyRender
This is a work-in-progress personal project in which I have challenged myself to write an entire renderer from scratch in C++.
I estimate that it is roughly 75-80% complete. 

Currently the only scene my algorithm has been tested on is [the standard "Cornell Box" scene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_box).
This scene has been hardcoded into the program and there is currently no way to import a scene or for the user to define his or her own scene. 
The plan for the project is to fix all bugs, test on more scenes, and allow the user to import their own scene for rendering.

This is a successful image of the Cornell Box drawn by my renderer:
