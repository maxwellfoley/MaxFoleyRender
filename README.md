# MaxFoleyRender
This is a personal project that I spent several months on in which I challenged myself to write an entire renderer from scratch in C++.
I estimate that it is roughly 75-80% complete. 

Currently the only scene it has been tested on is [the standard "Cornell Box" scene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_box).
This scene has been hardcoded into the program and there is currently no way to import a scene or for the user to define it. 
The plan for the project is to fix all bugs, test on more scenes, and allow the user to import their own scene for rendering.
